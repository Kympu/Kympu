### üó∫Ô∏è A Glimpse of My Development Journey...

-  [**Flight Planner**](https://github.com/Kympu/Flight-Planner) using C# in conjunction with the ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework (EF) Core frameworks. Employed SQL as the backend database system to create a robust web application for adding, removing, storing, and checking flights.
